Q1

```{r}

species_codes <- c( "GREG" = "Great Egret", "MALL" = "Mallard", "MAWR" = "Marsh Wren", "KILL" = "Killdeer"
)

sightings = c("GREG", "GREG", "MALL", "MAWR", "KILL", "GREG")

# Modify this line to use species_codes so your counts have common names

sightings <- table(sightings)
sightings[]

names(sightings) <- species_codes

setNames(table(sightings), species_codes)
```

Q2

Why adding 1 to a POSIXct datetime object increments it by a second - because the value of POSIXct vectors represents the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 (a double) and spit out a datetime format.

The default origin is 1970-01-01.

```{r}
new_now <- as.POSIXct(0, origin = "2000-01-01 12:00:00", tz = "UTC")
```

How to take away the POSIXct class?

```{r}
new_now
```
