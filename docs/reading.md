Exercises from Hadley Wickham, chapter 3

1. How do you create raw and complex scalars?
By using functions raw/as.raw and complex and as.complex. I'm not sure why I would need these at this point! 

2. Predicting outcomes: 
1,0
"a","1"
1,1

3. 1 == "1" is true because...? I think because 1 can be coerced by R into "1", and "1"=="1"
-1 < FALSE because False is 0
"one" < 2 is false because the word "one" cannot be coerced down - it's a string of characters

characters at top, logicals at the bottom - can coerce up but not down
